## Data Citation

### Citation Elements

Citing data is not different from citing a publication. Make sure to check the rules of the journal to know how you should cite when writing an article for a specific academic journal. For all of the journals, however, the minimum compulsory elements in a data citation include:

* Author(s): Name of the author (creator) of the dataset
* Title: Name of the dataset
* Date of publication
* Publisher: Archive where dataset is stored
* Persistent Identifier: Unique identifier, most common is the DOI (see section [Data Publication](http://libguides.vu.nl/researchdata/data-publication)).

Optional elements that may be included in the reference are:

* File Type: Codebook, movie, software
* Version: Version number of the edition
* Creation Date
* Date of Consultation (last)
