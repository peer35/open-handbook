# Compute environments
This pages tries to give an overview of the platforms available for VU researchers. By compute we mean all kinds of applications, such as:

- Data gathering
- Data analysis
- Hosting web applications
- Running (licensed) server applications
- Visualization

## Workstations and Laptops
### Laptop
Every VU researcher has a digital workplace, by default this is a standard laptop (Windows or Mac). The small formfactor means a laptop will have limited CPU and RAM and very little GPU power, enough for basic office tasks and light analysis tools

If the standard laptop is too slow for your tooling a more powerful workstation laptop might help.

https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=kb_article&table=kb_knowledge&sys_kb_id=588865b4874bc15010be65b40cbb3503

Pros:

- Always available, install software and go
- Can use graphical tools

Cons:

- Not all software is available on all OS's 
- Limited performance
- Can not run 24/7, especially laptops
- Can not host web applications for 3rd party

### Desktop

Desktop pcs have more powerful hardware. A better CPU, more RAM and a dedicated GPU can be added. 

Pros:

- Possible to run 24/7
- More performance than a laptop
- Always available, install software and go
- Can use graphical tools

Cons:

- Only availabe in "lab"-spaces. The modern VU "flex" workspace is just for laptops
- Single user, only one person at a time can login and run tasks
- Limited remote accessibility

## (Virtual) servers
A server gets around some limitations of a personal workstation. Virtual servers can be scaled to your needs, run 24/7 and be made accessible for multiple users, even over the internet.

### SciCloud
Pros:

- Fixed price per month
- Windows or Linux
- Can host web applications for 3rd parties
- Mount SciStor shares
- Possible to use GUI tools
- Create snapshots to backup your working configuration

Cons:

- No GPU available
- Some server maintenance necessary (application & OS updates)
- Not easy to start multiple identical servers 
- Knowledge needed on how to setup your environment(*)

(*) IT for Research will only install the basic OS and automate OS updates. Setup and maintenance of applications is your own responsibility. Time permitting we will do our best to help you get started.

### SURF Research Cloud
Pros:

- Windows or Linux
- Easier to spin up multiple identical servers
- GPU available
- Possible to use GUI tools
- Can host web applications for 3rd parties
- Make use of existing setups created by others
- There is a collaborative catalog of installs, chances are someone else will have figured out how to create a workspace with all the applications you need.

Cons:

- You page for usage so it is less suitable for hosting web applications that have to run 24/7
- No backup if your workspace (=servers) is deleted you have to rebuild it
- Some extra work needed to create scripts to make server rebuildable

### Azure Virtual Desktop
This is a Windows 11 environment 

Pros:

- Free for researchers
- Possible to use GUI tools

Cons:

- Windows only
- Can not leave running 24/7
- Extra software only available on request

### Physical servers
In unusual cases you need a server to run specific applications, but the performance of a Virtual Server on SciCloud is not sufficient or some other requitement demands physical hardware. 
In that case you could opt to buy your own hardware and host it in IT for research's Data Centre. 
IT will take care of the hardware and network connectivity, when absolutely necessary you can have physical access to the machine.

Please contact ITvO to discuss your requirements.

## HPC
Some tasks require more compute power. Running it on a laptop takes too long and a virtual server needs so much resources the task becomes very expensive. 
This is when High Performance Computing comes in view. The basic idea is that you have nodes with lots of RAM, CPU and GPU.
You submit your job (basically a script) to a queue along with hints about the amount of processing you need and the HPC cluster figures out the best moment to execute it.
The large amount of available compute resources mean it pays to figure out how to run your analysis in parallel tasks.

Pros:

- Massive amount resources available

Cons:

- Learning curve. Some commandline knowledge necessary
- Limited availability of GUI tools

### BAZIS (VU)
[Bazis](topics/bazis.html)
#### Buy your own nodes (VU)
### Snellius (SURF)
https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Snellius

Snellius is the Dutch National supercomputer hosted at SURF. The system facilitates scientific research carried out in many Universities, independent research institutes, governmental organizations, and private companies in the Netherlands. 

Snellius is a cluster of heterogeneous nodes built by Lenovo, containing predominantly AMD technology, with capabilities for high performance computing (parallel, symmetric multiprocessing), data-processing, and machine learning. The system also has several system-specific storage resources, that are geared towards supporting the various types of computing. 

The system has a peak performance of 14 petaflop/s, making it the most powerful high-performance computing system in the Netherlands.

### LUMI (European)

### VU JupyterHub for education 
https://hub.compute.vu.nl/

VU IT has built a Jupyter Notebook environment meant mainly for Education purposes, but accessible for researchers as well. 

Pros:

- Graphical interface available
- GPU available

Cons:

- Limited resources
- Limited amount of applications and modules available (but you can always ask the team to add something!)


## Highly secure environments 
In order to minimize the chances of data leaks IT Privacy & Security could require you to keep the data in a secure environment. 
You will work on a remote desktop with the analysis tools you need installed. The data will only be accessible from within the virtual environment. 
Only and IT admin or Data Manager will be able to install software and import or export data.
### SANE
### Custom solutions on SciCloud

## Containers
It is possible to spin up Docker containers on SciCloud, SURF Research Cloud and BAZIS.

Pros:

- Easier to spin up multiple indentical applications
- Platform independent, easy to develop on your laptop and then deploy somewhere else
- More reproducible, your Docker- and compose files document your setup
- Things don't break as easily on OS updates

Cons:

- Some knowledge about Docker needed
- Some CLI knowledge needed 

### OpenShift
OpenShift is a platform specifically created for hosting containers. 

Pros:

- CI/CD pipelines, e.g. push code on Github/Gitlab and automatically rebuild the container
- No need to worry about updating a (virtual) server

Cons:
- It takes extra work to make your containers suitable for OpenShift.

### Apptainer/Singularity on HPC

## Jupyter Notebooks [past dit hier?]??
### VU
### HPC
Both Snellius and BAZIS have a Jupyter interface available. This means you can execute Notebooks build on your laptop on a HPC cluster, making it an excellent way to get familiar with HPC.

https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Jupyter+Notebooks+on+Snellius
### Research Cloud
### Google Colab
Free for limited use, so an excellent place to share and play around with Jupyter Notebooks. Only use data which can be considered public.
