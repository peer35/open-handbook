## Introduction BAZIS

BAZIS is a high performance computing (HPC) cluster managed by the IT for Research department at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Use of BAZIS is purposed for students/researchers who need more computing power than a conventional computer offers to get their work done. BAZIS is a heterogeneous system composed of various sub-clusters (or so-called, partitions), in which each sub-cluster is owned by / assigned to a specific group of users. Additionally, a 'general' partition is also available for those who are not working on the cluster in the context of a specific research group. 

This set of pages contains all information to get started with BAZIS, such as how to login, hardware specs, use software on the cluster, tips and tricks.
